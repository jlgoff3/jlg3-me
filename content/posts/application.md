Honestly, I won't be your most qualified candidate. I'm young, relatively inexperienced, and I have a degree in education, not development. That means this probably won't be the best application you'll see. It won't be the coolest, niftiest, most visually stunning page you've ever seen, but I hope this will be the most passionate and human application you see.

I was born in '96, and I don't remember ever not working and playing around with computers. My first program was a sales tax calculator written in Color Computer BASIC on a napkin in elementary school. I was learning about tax and percentages in math class, my dad was teaching me BASIC, and I was excited by both. I wish I still had that napkin.

I don't remember a time without open source either. The first computer I built ran Ubuntu, in part because I couldn't afford a Windows license. Blender, Inkscape, and Gimp helped me win interscholastic fine arts competitions for graphic design all through junior high and high school. I'm excited by the expansion in recent years of open source and sustainable business models that are user-focused and accessible. My life has been greatly benefited by open source, and I think Tailwind would be a great way to give back.

I discovered Tailwind probably six months ago, and I've been fascinated by your work ever since. I currently work for a small Midwestern machine shop as a full-stack developer, helping develop an in-house ERP using a Vue(with Vuetify)/Express/Node/Postgres stack. While Vuetify is great for rapid prototyping, as a designer, I eventually run into stifling limitations when using pre-built components, which is why I *love* the granular, unopinionated nature of Tailwind.

Working with me means you get somebody who knows the value of both ideas and execution. In college, I studied math education with an English minor and participated in a lot of main stage theatre (I led [the Music Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCM_n0GDxps), in case you're bored and enjoy small university theatre). I say this just to explain that I enjoy the logical and creative sides of life, the results and the process. I'm also versatile and love to both learn and teach, so I think I make an especially good contributor to small teams.

Let me quickly pitch you 3 partially-baked ideas, then I'll say my farewell.

**3 ideas for TailwindCSS**

1. **Community Improvement - A "windy" garden**

CSS Zen Garden introduced me to the wonders of raw CSS and good HTML. I'd love to see TailwindCSS have a "Windy" Garden, where users can submit their skinning of a basic layout, using Tailwind classes only. It'd be a great opportunity for the community to show their skills and simultaneously advertise the capability of Tailwind.

2. **Distribution Improvement - Expanded CDN**

Something like Google Fonts distribution, where the server intelligently serves the data you need. Tailwind could allow end users to choose Theming options that would typically be set in tailwind.config.js while choosing their CDN package. I believe Font Awesome does similar packaging.

3. **Core Feature Improvement - CSS Grid Implementation**

I think that the CSS Grid implementation could be expanded to include some of the additional features of the spec, namely the grid-template-areas. Users could define grid templates in tailwind.config.js, then Tailwind generates the necessary classes, e.g. "grid--default", "grid-header", "grid-footer", etc.

Thank you for reading my application. I hope I didn't lose you along the way. I'll close by saying that I'm currently finishing an invoicing system that I built for my current employer's in-house ERP, and I would love to talk about how I did it to demonstrate my capability. Any task you give me, I either can do, or I will learn how to do by researching, asking questions, and teaching myself as I go. Even though I will not be the most experienced candidate or the most qualified, I hope you at least enjoyed my application. Thank you!
