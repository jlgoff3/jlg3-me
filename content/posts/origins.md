It's April 30th, 2020.

It's 6:54 AM, and I'm listening to Crystal Silence by Chick Corea. As Corea and Gary Burton experiment with sounds, melodies, harmonies, and rhythms, I feel strangely alone. It's not so strange. I live at home, but no one but me is awake at 7:00 AM, especially not during *this*. *This* being the coronavirus global pandemic of 2020. Everyone is at home, a fifth of America is unemployed, and the light at the end of the tunnel is obscured by the political dancers in our state and federal governments.

Se√±or Mouse starts playing. I look up Chick Corea, to learn more about who he was beyond the keyboard. Wikipedia tells me he was a friend of L. Ron Hubbard and very interested in Scientology. It's a shame to me that such a talented musician could fall prey to such strange beliefs, but it reminds me that we all have our weaknesses. We have to keep a watch out for those we have influence over.

People have been protesting the stay at home order, and better yet, they've resorted to name-calling. I've heard my governor, Gretchen Whitmer, called "Dimwhitmer" and "Whitler," and it's disappointing. Disappointing because I want to believe that people can be better than that. Disappointing because people seem to care so little about those beyond their sphere of influence. It's something I think Spider-man missed.

My brother and I have been watching a lot of Spider-man during this quarantine. First there was the 2011 *Ultimate Spider-man* series, and when that ran out, we started watching the 2017 *Disney's Spider-man*. Currently, we're watching 2008s *Spectacular Spider-man*, my personal favorite and my brother's "no really, it's okay, I like it"-ite, at least until *Disney's Spider-man" comes onto Disney+ with its new season.

Everybody's heard it: with great power comes great responsibility. Uncle Ben's words are burned into our collective remembrance. I think the implied smaller truth is this: with any power comes great responsibility. We may not have the ability to literally fight crime or climb the side of a building or pull off spandex, but we do have the power to go mow our elderly neighbor's lawn. We do have the power to treat the people we come across in our daily lives with the respect and kindness they deserve. We have the power to love the unlovable people around us.

It's 8:57 PM now. I'm starting to feel tired, and I put on some McCoy Tyner. His jarring and innovative, ancient but fun quartal voicings teach lessons from the past. The sound is timeless, and it's easy to become nostalgic for the days of jazz gone by. I wish I'd been alive to see the concerts of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Cannonball Adderley, and the icon that was Thelonious Monk. Losing myself in a hazy dream of a past I will never experience sounds like a nice escape in all this punk-modern dysphoria. But the past doesn't exist for us to live our fantasies in - it is a textbook, which, as any school-aged kid knows, is meant to be hastily read and promptly ditched. We know that so many historical tragedies have brought with them great innovation. King Lear was born of a plague. Jazz was born of black suffering. What will be born this during this tragedy?

It's 9:09 PM. One day to write one brief article. An introduction, maybe an origin story of sorts. I choose to create in this time, though no thing I make is of such quality as the heroic efforts I've mentioned before. I've heard that the hero is dead, maybe that's right. After all, none of us really seem to have much power these days. Maybe the hero is unattainable. What is attainable is that joint effort to care for those who need care, to help those in need, to be kind those who need it, whether or not they deserve. Make this coronavirus pandemic the origin story for the golden age of collective heroism that rises after.

Respectfully Yours,

Jay Goff
